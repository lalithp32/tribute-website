                <h2>The God Of Cricket</h2>
                <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, (born April 24, 1973, Bombay [Mumbai], India), Indian professional cricket
                    player, considered by many to be one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In 2012 he became the
                    first cricketer to score 100 centuries (100 runs in a single innings) in international play.

                    Tendulkar was given his first bat when he was 11 years of age. As a 14-year-old, he used it to score
                    329 out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match. A year later he scored a century on his
                    first-class debut for Bombay (Mumbai), and at age 16 years 205 days he became India’s youngest Test
                    (international) cricketer, making his debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989. When he
                    was 18 he scored two centuries in Australia (148 in Sydney and 114 in Perth), and in 1994 he scored
                    179 against the West Indies. In August 1996, at age 23, Tendulkar was made captain of his country’s
                    team.</p>
